# topic-vectors
3D plotting of topic vectors on rare diseases extracted from PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central articles.

You need a few files and folders to make this work:
- /en_product7.xml, which can be downloaded on Orphanet
- /corpus/, which contains all sentences
- /figures/, which contains the 3D scatter plots
- /orphanet/, which contains the Orphanet pages
- /pmc/, which contains the PubMed Central articles
- /pubmed/, which contains the PubMed abstracts
